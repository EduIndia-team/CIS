# Code Innovation Series 🎉
Welcome to GitHub Education

Code Innovation Series - an open source focussed student developer skilling program in GitHub Campus Schools across the country. 
Code Innovation Series is an exclusive student camp to get started with GitHub contributing to Open Source at our Campus Program Schools in India. 

GitHub is the developer company. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.

We would like to invite you'll to attend the workshop and weekend-hackathon as a part of this program. Below is a registration link to help you learn and implement. Looking forward to putting this together under your patronage at the earliest convenience.

Students on completion of the hands-on workshop would be provided with certificates. The workshop will be delivered by Synergetics Information Technology Services India Pvt. Ltd. We also have some exclusive GitHub swags 🎁 to giveaways for our top weekend hackathon projects.
